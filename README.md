# retrotube cleaned
this is my attempt of trying to sanitize retrotube's source code.
# how to install
1. upload the files to ur server
2. make sure that "logins.txt" is at chmod 666 or 644
3. update "global.php" to your mysql server credentials
4. install or copy the code for "retrotube-clean.sql" and "admin.sql"
5. go to "admin.php" and change the password to whatever you want.
   and now you have a retrotube-cleaned instance, good luck!
